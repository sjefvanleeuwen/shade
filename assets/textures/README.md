# Texture Assets

This directory should contain the following texture files:
- test.png - Test texture for general purpose use
- floor.png - Texture for the floor in the game
- player.png - Texture for the player character
- obstacle.png - Texture for obstacles
- collectible.png - Texture for collectible items
- menu_background.png - Background texture for the menu

You can add your own texture files here following these naming conventions, or modify the code to use different filenames.
