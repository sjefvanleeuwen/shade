# Sound Assets

This directory should contain the following sound files:
- hit.mp3 - Sound played when the player hits an obstacle
- collect.mp3 - Sound played when the player collects an item
- gameOver.mp3 - Sound played when the game is over
- levelComplete.mp3 - Sound played when a level is completed

You can add your own sound files here following these naming conventions, or modify the code to use different filenames.
